Smart Contract Applications on Hedera Hashgraph

Introduction:

Welcome to the Smart Contract Applications on Hedera Hashgraph repository! This project showcases a collection of smart contract applications built on the Hedera Hashgraph network. Hedera Hashgraph is a decentralized public network that utilizes Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology to achieve fast and secure consensus.

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They enable trustless and transparent interactions between parties, ensuring that predefined conditions are automatically enforced without the need for intermediaries.

In this repository, we explore various use cases where smart contracts on the Hedera network can be leveraged to create decentralized, secure, and efficient applications.
